## read_the_manual

Although programmers love to say that "everything" is in the documentation and that you need
to "read the fucking manual"---a sentiment which I very much understand---the official
documentation is, usually, not that helpful. To be blunt, it's sometimes (often?) the worst place
to look when you want to learn how to a language works. But there is a value and a beauty to
official documentation---as opposed to tutorials, guides, courses, etc.---so this folder contains
summaries/notes of the official documentation for different functions and packages.

* `eval`: evaluate an (Unevaluated) Expression
